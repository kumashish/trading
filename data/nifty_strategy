PRE-TRADE (5 MINUTES – MANDATORY)
1️⃣ Market Anchors

☐ NIFTY spot ≈ current level

☐ India VIX:

< 12 → Calendars / Diagonals allowed

12–16 → Spreads only

16 → Reduce size / no new risk

2️⃣ Forecast Reference

☐ Use latest Base / ±1σ / ±2σ table

☐ No recalculating mid-week

☐ Strikes must map to σ bands

🔹 PORTFOLIO LIMITS (DO NOT VIOLATE)

☐ Max expiries open: 3

☐ Naked options: ZERO

☐ Margin usage ≤ 35%

☐ Max loss per expiry ≤ 1% capital

☐ Total −2σ downside (all expiries) ≤ 3% capital

If any box fails → Reduce positions, don’t adjust strikes

🔹 STRUCTURE SELECTION (CHOOSE ONE PER EXPIRY)
🟢 WEEKLY (Cashflow Layer)

☐ Structure: Put Spread / Put Diagonal

☐ Sell PUT ≈ −0.5σ

☐ Buy PUT ≈ −1σ

☐ No call selling unless VIX > 14

☐ Profit target: 30–40%

☐ Exit if daily close < short strike

🟡 MONTHLY (Core Engine)

☐ Structure: Downside-Skewed Iron Condor

☐ Sell PUT = −1σ

☐ Buy PUT = −2σ

☐ Sell CALL = +1σ to +1.5σ

☐ Buy CALL = +2σ

☐ Profit target: 40–50%

☐ No adjustment unless −1σ breaks with momentum

🔵 FAR-MONTH (Stabiliser)

☐ Structure: Put Diagonal / Double Calendar

☐ Long option must exist

☐ Vega ≥ neutral

☐ No naked selling

☐ Leave untouched unless IV spikes

🔹 POSITION SIZING CHECK

☐ Weekly risk ≤ 0.5% capital

☐ Monthly risk ≤ 1% capital

☐ Combined open risk ≤ 2% capital

☐ Shares margin drawdown considered

If unsure → halve size

🔹 DAILY MONITORING (2 MINUTES)
Do NOTHING if:

☐ Spot inside ±1σ

☐ IV stable or falling slowly

☐ MTM noise only

ACT ONLY if:

☐ Spot breaks −1σ with momentum

☐ IV spikes > 20%

☐ Margin usage crosses 35%

🔹 ADJUSTMENT RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)
🔻 Downside Move

☐ Close PUT spread if −1σ breaks hard

☐ Keep CALL side intact

☐ Optionally convert to diagonal

🔺 Upside Move

☐ Ignore until +1σ tested

☐ Do NOT chase rolls

☐ Calls are intentionally far

🔹 WHAT YOU NEVER DO (READ DAILY)

❌ Add size to recover MTM
❌ Sell naked puts
❌ Add new expiry without closing old
❌ Trade based on “feel”
❌ Adjust good structures due to noise

🔹 WEEKLY RESET (FRIDAY / MONDAY)

☐ Book profits

☐ Close expiring legs

☐ Recheck margin usage

☐ Confirm forecast still valid

☐ Prepare next week’s strikes

🧠 FINAL REMINDER (MOST IMPORTANT)

Forecast chooses strikes
Structure limits damage
Size decides survival

If something feels stressful → your size is wrong, not the strategy.
