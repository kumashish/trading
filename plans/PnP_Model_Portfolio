🧩 CORE PRINCIPLE: SELL TIME, BUY SPEED
Sell theta where moves are slow
Buy convexity where moves are fast
Never sell speed naked

This leads to a three-layer portfolio.
1️⃣ BASE LAYER (60–70% of risk)
Income engine aligned with long-term bull market Structure
Put-skewed credit spreads
Calls farther OTM than puts
Mostly monthly / weekly

Example:
Sell 25Δ Put / Buy 10Δ Put
Sell 10Δ Call / Buy 3Δ Call

Why this works?:
Market drift supports puts
Calls rarely explode in low IV
Downside loss is defined
📈 This captures grind-up + sideways markets
📉 Survives normal corrections

2️⃣ SHOCK ABSORBER LAYER (20–25%)
You explicitly PAY for downside speed protection

This is where most traders refuse to spend money — you won’t.

A) Long Downside Convexity (cheap, persistent)
30–60 DTE deep OTM put spreads
OR broken-wing put butterflies

Rules:
Size: small but constant
Treat as insurance, not a trade
Roll monthly

Why:
When markets fall, IV explodes faster than price
These pay disproportionately in panic

📉 Drawdown smoothing
📈 Lets you continue selling premium when others freeze

B) Calendar Puts (event-agnostic)
Buy next-month ATM put
Sell front-week ATM put

Why:
Gains from IV spike
Directionally neutral-ish
No tail risk

3️⃣ OPPORTUNISTIC LAYER (10–15%)
Only activated AFTER sharp downmoves

This is where your long-term bullishness prints money.

A) Post-shock Put Spreads (Mean Reversion)
Trigger:
≥1.5% down day
VIX spike > 15–20%

Structure:
Buy ATM Put
Sell lower Put (defined risk)
This is not catching a falling knife — it’s exploiting panic mispricing.

B) Call Diagonals after volatility crush
Once the panic fades:
Buy 2–3 month ATM call
Sell weekly calls repeatedly

You monetize:
IV crush
Slow recovery grind
