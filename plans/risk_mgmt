6️⃣ Automatic Position Sizing (CORE LOGIC)
Step 1: Define Risk Per Trade
Max risk per trade = 0.6–0.8% of SAM
With ₹36L SAM → ₹22k–₹29k

Step 2: Compute Max Lots Automatically
Formula:
Max Lots = (Allowed Risk per Trade) ÷ (Max Loss per Lot)

Example:
Spread max loss per lot = ₹9,000
Risk budget = ₹27,000
👉 Max lots = 3

7️⃣ Portfolio-Level Lot Caps (Hard Stops)
Metric	Rule
Total open risk	≤ 6–7% of SAM
Same-side exposure	≤ 60% of total risk
Same expiry risk	≤ 35%
Weekly net theta	+0.15% to +0.3% of SAM

9️⃣ Post-Trade Management Rules
